If you use *MQT QMAP* in your work, we would appreciate if you cited

- {cite:p}`zulehnerEfficientMethodologyMapping2019` when using the heuristic mapper,
- {cite:p}`willeMappingQuantumCircuits2019` when using the exact mapper,
- {cite:p}`peham2023DepthOptimalSynthesis` when using the Clifford circuit synthesis approach,
- {cite:p}`schmid2024HybridCircuitMapping` when using the hybrid mapper for neutral atom quantum computers,
- {cite:p}`stadeAbstractModelEfficient2024` when using the neutral atom logical array compiler (NALAC),
- {cite:p}`stadeOptimalStatePreparation2024` when using the optimal state preparation for neutral atoms (NASP), and
- {cite:p}`stadeRoutingAwarePlacement2025` when using the routing-aware placement for zoned neutral atom devices.

Furthermore, if you use any of the particular algorithms such as

- the heuristic mapping scheme using teleportation {cite:p}`hillmichExlpoitingQuantumTeleportation2021`
- the search space limitation techniques of the exact mapper (some of which are enabled per default) {cite:p}`burgholzer2022limitingSearchSpace`
- the method for finding (near-)optimal subarchitectures {cite:p}`peham2023OptimalSubarchitectures`

please consider citing their respective papers as well.
